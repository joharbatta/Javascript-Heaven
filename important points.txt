-- when we run js code global execution context will create in call stack and it has global object(window) and this keyboard
where window==this

---HOISTING
Only var and function are hoisted when code will run it only see for var and function | and allocated memory in memory heap
cosnt and let are not hoisted
var - partially hoisted (undefined)
func - fully hoisted

hoisting happens every execution context any time we run a function a new execution context gets created 
we have to go through creation and execution phase again
